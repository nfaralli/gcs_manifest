## GCS Manifest: Privacy Policy

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Most data (e.g. Name) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. The Drop Zone and date are the only data sent to the GCS servers in order to fetch the manifest data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Nicolas Faralli.

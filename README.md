# GCS Manifest 1.0.0

Welcome to GCS Manifest, a mobile-friendly version of the manifest provided by [Ground Control Skydiving](https://app.gcskydiving.com) [GCS].

To start using this app you will need to enter the Drop Zone code in the settings. \
Once done you will be able to see the current **Stand-By**, **Gear-Up**, and **In Air** loads. \
Loads are then automatically updated every minute. \
The app may not display any loads for multiple reasons:
* The Drop Zone is closed that day
* No new loads are being scheduled at the moment (e.g. weather hold, end of day where all the loads are already landed, etc.)

This app is provided on an "As Is" basis and was not developped by GCS. \
The official [GCS website]((https://app.gcskydiving.com)) (usually displayed on TVs at your local Drop Zone) will always be the source of truth!

This app provides the following features:

* Easily scroll between loads.
* Highlight your loads.
* Hide/display **Stand-By**, **Gear-Up**, **In Air**, and/or **Landed** loads for the current day.

For bug reports or new feature requests, please post a discussion on GitHub.

Thanks and I hope you'll enjoy this app! ^^ \
